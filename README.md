This is a just playground project.
I had made this project through below command line
```bash
yarn create next-app --typescript
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
